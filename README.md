## About

I’m a versatile CAD Designer with a strong foundation in 3D modeling, mechanical design, and product development. I specialize in creating precise, production-ready models using tools like Fusion 360, OnShape, and SolidWorks. My design approach emphasizes manufacturability, testing, and iterative prototyping across a variety of fabrication methods including FDM/SLA 3D printing, CNC machining, and laser cutting.

This portfolio showcases a range of professional and personal projects—such as a modular mecha display system, a fully custom electric skateboard, and CoreXY printer upgrades—all of which reflect my ability to take designs from concept to functional reality. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I aim to deliver designs that are not only mechanically sound but also user-ready and aesthetically refined.

I’m especially drawn to projects that blend mechanical design with real-world impact, including those in the hardware and biomedical device space. I also bring a working knowledge of Python and JavaScript, which I’m exploring for CAD automation and parametric scripting.
