# Kevin Lin — CAD Designer & Product Development Portfolio

Welcome to my professional CAD and product development portfolio! This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, showcasing mechanical design, prototyping workflows, and fabrication-ready projects spanning professional and self-directed work.


## Purpose
This portfolio is intended for roles in:

- CAD Design
- Mechanical Design
- Product Design
- Product Development & R&D
- Prototyping & Fabrication

It highlights real-world projects that demonstrate design-for-manufacturability (DFM), tolerance optimization, and end-to-end prototyping workflows.


## Live Demo
You can visit my portfolio <a href="https://codeviith.github.io/devdesigner" target="_blank">here</a>.


## Featured Projects
| Project | Focus | Skills Demonstrated |
|--------|-------|--------------------|
| DYPLAB Modular Display System | Product design & attachments | Manufacturability, tolerance refinement |
| DIY Electric Skateboard | Structural mechanical design | Parametric CAD, stress optimization, prototyping |
| Custom CoreXY 3D Printer | Precision motion system | Mechanical calibration, modular design |
| Product Modifications | Functional redesign | Ergonomics, iterative prototyping |


## Metrics & Outcomes
- Designed multiple functional prototypes and hardware builds
- Produced small-batch production runs
- Improved tolerance accuracy through iterative refinement
- Reduced material waste via DFM optimization
- Validated hardware systems through real-world use


## About
I’m a CAD Designer and Product Developer with hands-on experience in mechanical design, parametric modeling, and end-to-end prototyping. I specialize in creating precise, manufacturable components using Fusion 360, SolidWorks, and Onshape.

My work emphasizes:

- Design for manufacturability
- Structural integrity and tolerance accuracy
- Iterative prototyping and testing
- A variety of fabrication methods, including FDM/SLA 3D printing, CNC machining, and laser cutting
- Real-world fabrication workflows

Projects in this portfolio include functional mechanical assemblies, custom hardware systems, and modular product designs. I focus on turning conceptual ideas into production-ready hardware that balances form, function, and manufacturability. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I aim to deliver designs that are not only mechanically sound but also user-ready and aesthetically refined.

I’m especially drawn to projects that blend mechanical design with real-world impact, including those in the hardware and biomedical device space. I also bring a working knowledge of Python and JavaScript, which I’m exploring for CAD automation, scripting, and workflow efficiency.


## What Sets This Portfolio Apart
- Focus on manufacturable, real-world products  
- Emphasis on tolerance and fit validation  
- Iterative prototype testing, not just concept modeling  
- Integration of electronics and mechanical systems  
- Functional assemblies instead of isolated parts  
- Documentation of fabrication workflows  


## Design Workflow
My design process typically follows a structured design workflow:

1. Problem definition & requirement analysis  
2. Parametric CAD modeling  
3. Rapid prototyping (FDM / SLA / CNC)  
4. Testing & tolerance refinement  
5. Iterative redesign  
6. Production-ready documentation  

This ensures designs are not just visually accurate, but mechanically reliable and fabrication-ready.
